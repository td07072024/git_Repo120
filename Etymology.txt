The origin of the name panda is uncertain, but one of the most likely theories is that it derived from the Nepali word "ponya".[3] The word पञ्जा pajā or पौँजा pañjā means "ball of the foot" and "claws".[4] The Nepali words "nigalya ponya" has been translated as "bamboo-footed" and is thought to be the red panda's Nepali name; in English, it was simply called panda, and was the only animal known under this name for more than 40 years; it became known as the red panda or lesser panda to distinguish it from the giant panda, which was formally described and named in 1869.[3]

The genus name Ailurus is adopted from the Ancient Greek word αἴλουρος ailouros meaning 'cat'.[5] The specific epithet fulgens is Latin for 'shining, bright'.
